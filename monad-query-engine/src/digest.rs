//! Artifact content checksums for standby ingest verification.
//!
//! Two replicas ingesting the same finalized block stream must reach
//! byte-identical digests, so every chain here is a function of the LOGICAL
//! block stream only — never of flush cadence, pack boundaries, compression,
//! dict versions, physical keys, or timing.
//!
//! Two independent chains:
//!
//! 1. **Row chain** (data track). Each block's logical content (number, hash,
//!    parent hash, EVM header bytes, per-family windows + uncompressed row
//!    payloads) folds into [`block_content_digest`]; per-block digests chain
//!    into the running value stored in every
//!    [`BlockRecord`](monad_query_primitives::records::BlockRecord)
//!    `row_chain`, so one 32-byte value certifies the whole history.
//!
//! 2. **Seal chains** (index track), one per family. Open-page FRAGMENTS are
//!    flush-cadence artifacts and MUST NOT be hashed; sealed page/bucket
//!    artifacts are content-deterministic (the union of everything in a 64K
//!    id span) and keyed by id-space position, so they chain deterministically.
//!    When a span seals, [`SealDigest`] hashes the exact persisted artifact
//!    bytes in canonical order and the result folds into the family's chain,
//!    persisted alongside the seal batch.
//!
//! Verification recipe: a standby comparison reads the primary's
//! `row_chain` at height N (row data equality through N, stored on every
//! `BlockRecord`) plus each family's `(last sealed span, seal_chain)` row
//! (index equality through the sealed frontier) and compares against its own.
//!
//! Determinism: row bytes are hashed pre-compression (and frame offsets are
//! excluded) so the checksum is independent of the zstd codec/version;
//! variable-length fields are length-prefixed; unordered sets are folded in
//! canonical sorted order; fixed-width fields are little-endian.
