//! queryX ingest (write path): the branchless single-writer ingest engine that
//! indexes finalized blocks into the engine's tables, plus the
//! `ChainDataIngestSource` seam that block sources implement.
//!
//! ```text
//! producer (fetch, assign ids, emit signals) ─┬─► data track  (pack rows, write blobs)
//!                                              └─► index engine (accumulate, seal, flush, write)
//!                  publisher: head = newest flush boundary <= data_durable
//! ```
//!
//! The index engine is branchless across modes: bits accumulate in [`OpenTail`];
//! `seal` continuously writes completed granules (`OpenState[g] ∪ OpenTail[g]`);
//! `batch_flush` writes each `OpenTail` entry as a fragment, carries it into
//! [`OpenState`], and records the tip as a publishable flush boundary;
//! `checkpoint` snapshots both once the data track's flush is durable — it
//! neither writes fragments nor records a boundary. Artifacts are written
//! inline and durable on return, so `batch_flush` records the boundary without
//! a sink barrier.
//!
//! There is no backfill/live mode: the engine always follows the tip ("backfill"
//! is just the catch-up phase); the [`SignalPolicy`] cadences are the only knobs,
//! and `end` is a run bound, not a mode.
