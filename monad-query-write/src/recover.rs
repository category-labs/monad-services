//! Crash recovery: resume from `max(checkpoint_block, published_head)`.
//!
//! During backfill flushes are rare, so the checkpoint (which captures both
//! `OpenState` and `OpenTail`) runs ahead of the head and wins. Live at the tip,
//! flushes are frequent and checkpoints rare, so the durable fragments at the
//! head encode the full `OpenState` and win. The rebuild only reads existing
